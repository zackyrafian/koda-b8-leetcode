/**
 * 137. Single Number II
 * Medium
 * Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.
 
 You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.
 
  
 
 Example 1:
 
 Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
 Output: 3
 Example 2:
 
 Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
 Output: 99
  
 
 Constraints:
 
 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
 -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
 Each element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.
